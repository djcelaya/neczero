El hecho de nacer temprano puede aumentar el riesgo de NEC porque muchos órganos todavía no han desarrollado completamente y sus sistemas inmunes son inmaduros.

Most signs of NEC are first recognized by the neonate’s bedside nurse who must then communicate with a provider who can determine a plan for diagnostic testing and treatment. This communication process sometimes involves multiple care providers and is sometimes complicated by institutional and social factors with potential for information to be miscommunicated or lost. Using a standard communication tool such as SBAR may increase effectiveness.";
