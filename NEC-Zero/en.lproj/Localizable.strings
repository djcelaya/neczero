In some cases, your baby may require additional procedures or surgeries.  An example of an additional surgery is sewing the healthy intestine back together, or sometimes a baby may require an ostomy.

"Many babies will recover fully from NEC..." = "Many babies will recover fully from NEC and not have further feeding problems. However, sometimes babies with NEC may have complications such as a scarred or narrowed bowel or intestinal blockage. If so, more surgery is needed. Because of the impact on the intestine, the baby’s ability to absorb food can be disrupted. Many babies receive nutrition intravenously for a long time while their bowel is resting. When feedings are restarted, the bowel sometimes has trouble absorbing nutrients (malabsorption). Babies who have had part of their intestine removed are more prone to this. A baby with malabsorption may need nutrition delivered directly into a vein until the intestine heals enough to tolerate normal feeding. This can lead to long-term complications including something called “short gut syndrome.” Losing so much bowel can also cause long-term health problems like allergies and organ failure among others.";
