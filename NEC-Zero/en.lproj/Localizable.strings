"This infection can cause damage to the bowel over time..." = "This infection can cause damage to the bowel over time, which can lead to the death of portions of the bowel. In some cases, a hole can form in the bowel, known as a perforation. If the bowel breaks open, it can cause the infection to spread throughout the body.";
"Often NEC impacts babies who are born very early and very small..." = "Often NEC impacts babies who are born very early and very small. Being born early can increase the risk of NEC because many organs have not yet fully developed and their immune systems are immature. Infants who develop NEC are typically preterm, which means they are born before 32 weeks of pregnancy (gestation). However, NEC can also occur in babies who are born at 37 weeks (full term) of pregnancy.";

A comprehensive understanding of vital sign trends and abdominal/gastrointestinal assessment findings associated with NEC may help to distinguish NEC from other clinical problems.";

Most signs of NEC are first recognized by the neonate’s bedside nurse who must then communicate with a provider who can determine a plan for diagnostic testing and treatment. This communication process sometimes involves multiple care providers and is sometimes complicated by institutional and social factors with potential for information to be miscommunicated or lost. Using a standard communication tool such as SBAR may increase effectiveness.";
